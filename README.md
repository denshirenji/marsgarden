# Marsgarden
Here is my CS50x project! Thank you a million times to CS50x for being totally awesome.

This app queries the Nasa Insight mars lander API for weather from mars. Then, you can buy and sell mars garden plants. The weather affects how the plants grow, then if you're lucky, you can sell the plants for more than you bought them.

Good luck!
